I love to understand how fountain pen works and write with them. This page contains some resources about fountain pens. 

1. [Fountain pen 101 series](https://blog.gouletpens.com/fountain-pen-education/fountain-pen-101) : good to understand about the basics of fountain pens. A must watch for beginners. 

2. [SBEBrown's reviews](https://www.youtube.com/user/sbrebrown) : You will find the review of almost any fountain pen you want. The channel also has ink reviews.

3. [The FPN Network](http://www.fountainpennetwork.com) : The world wide fountain pen community for everyone. They also have a very active group in facebook.

4. [Krishna pens and inks](http://krishnapens.in/): While I am not promoting anyone, I found their inks to be of good quality and reasonably priced compared to other inks that we get in India. It's a good alternative to the expensive Japanese/Foriegn inks. They have a lot of variety too.


Will update this page later.
