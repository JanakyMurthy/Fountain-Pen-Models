# Desi Fountain pen makers

Finding fountain pen shops/brand in India is quite tough. I think this is mainly due to the fact that they don't spend much on advertising. Anyway, here is a growing list of where to buy fountain pens and inks in India.

1. **Ratnamson Pens**

The oldest handmade fountain pen makers from Rajahmundry with rich history. I looove their pens. The make pens on request and what surprises me is how affordable these pens are (starts as low as Rs.250). The only downside I experienced is that they take a long time to make the pen. This is understandable as the pen maker is very old now.

2. **Ranga Pens**

I have not personally bought anything from here. But I have heard good reviews about them too.

3. **ASA Pens**

Again, have heard extremely good reviews about some of their models.

4. **Krishna Inks**

Started by Dr.Sreekumar Neethu, a Palakkad based doctor and fountain pen hobbyist, they have one of the best collection of good quality **inks**. Their inks are amazing and I can vouch for it. They also sell pens (I haven't used any of their pens).
